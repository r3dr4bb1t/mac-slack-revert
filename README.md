# mac-slack-revert
Revert slack to old version on mac os

# How to revert
1. download two files: slack_revert, slackStarter.sh
2. change path in slackStarter.sh to where "slack_revert" is
3. open slack (new version)
4. execute slackStarter.sh

# Idea
- not sure how long this method would be possible
- sometimes when it restarts, you have to run below again -> maybe can tweak background app to launch everytime slack opens
